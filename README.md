![Game of Life Demo](demo.gif)

## Description

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game that simulates the evolution of cells on a grid based on simple rules. This repository contains an interactive web application that visually demonstrates the Game of Life using JavaScript and HTML Canvas.
IT WAS COMPLETELY MADE BY GPT. ALL I DID WAS ENGINEER THE PROMPT AND REARRANGE 20% OF THE CODE. 

## Features

- Interactive simulation of Conway's Game of Life.
- Click and drag to toggle cell states.
- Start, pause, and reset the simulation.
- Adjust simulation speed.
- **Coming Soon:** Integration of a backend using Django to allow users to save and share patterns, and collaborate on evolving the simulation.

## Demo

[Live Demo](https://your-demo-link-here.com)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the simulation.
3. Click on cells to toggle their state.
4. Use the controls to start, pause, and reset the simulation.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the simulation.
- `script.js`: JavaScript code for simulating the Game of Life and handling user interactions.
- `styles.css`: CSS styles for the user interface.
- `demo.gif`: A GIF demonstrating the simulation in action.

## Getting Involved

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and ensure they are well-tested.
4. Submit a pull request.

## Future Plans

- Implement backend using Django for saving and sharing patterns.
- Allow users to collaborate on evolving the simulation.
- Enhance UI/UX and customization options.
